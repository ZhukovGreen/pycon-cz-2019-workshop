    "NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a powerful N-dimensional array object\n",
    "\n",
    "- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code\n",
    "\n",
    "- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.\n",

    "### pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "https://pandas.pydata.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.\n",

    "\n",
    "https://matplotlib.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. You can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code. \n",
