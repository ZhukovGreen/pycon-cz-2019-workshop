# The Data Trinity â€“ Practical Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib

[PyCon CZ 2019, PyData track workshop](https://cz.pycon.org/2019/programme/workshops/8/#main)


## Instructions

Please read and follow [the workshop instructions](instructions.md) carefully. 

We are *progressively updating* this repository. Ideally, *clone or update this repository* the day before the workshop starts.


## Contents

In this tutorial, you will get your hands on the basic toolbox of any Python data analyst or scientist.
Based on publicly available data, you will learn how to:

* Compute effectively with numeric arrays with NumPy (covering topics such as indexing and slicing, matrix operations, vectorized functions, broadcasting)
* Perform data manipulation and queries in pandas (explaining data frames, data I/O, data cleaning, complex indexing, aggregation, grouping)
* Visualize your results with Matplotlib (showing various types of plots and backends, mentioning alternatives when useful)
